**Dataset** : *Tweets gender dataset*

<h3>Following Steps were taken to make this project:- </h3>

* #### EDA and Visualization
* #### Appied generic python(regex) to clean the data
* #### Method Used
  * ##### Random Forest Classification
  * ##### Naive Bayes
  * ##### Decision Tree
  
**How to use the Code**:
1. Install the necessary library like Anaconda, nltk etc.
2. Fork this repository and you are ready to go

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

Twitter Sentiment Analyse is always a topic research. It has lot emotion used by different people.It becomes very difficult to extract the exact emotion that you are targeting. We tried to build these model with our all effort. And try to answer the Question like * What is most commom emotion used by the people*??
